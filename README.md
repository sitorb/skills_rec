# Skills Recommendation System
This project aims to build a recommendation system that suggests relevant skills to job seekers based on their current resume and desired job category. It leverages a dataset of resumes and their corresponding categories to identify the most in-demand skills for various roles and recommend missing skills to users.

## Project Structure
UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv: The dataset containing resume data.
skills_recommendation.py: The main Python script containing the project code.
README.md: This file, providing project details.

## Logic and Algorithm
### Data Preparation:

Load the dataset (UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv) using Pandas.
Extract the 'Category' and 'Resume' columns.
Define a function extract_skills to extract relevant skills from the resume text using regex patterns.

### Skill Analysis:

Group the resumes by their category and aggregate the extracted skills.
Create a dictionary skill_category_mapping to map each category to its associated skills.
Identify the top 10 skills for each category based on frequency and store them in top_skills_per_category.

### Recommendation Logic:

Define a function recommend_skills to provide recommendations.
This function takes the user's resume and target category as input.
It extracts skills from the user's resume using the extract_skills function.
It compares the user's skills with the top skills for the target category.
It identifies any missing skills and returns them as recommendations.

## Implementation and Usage:

Obtain the user's resume and target category.
Call the recommend_skills function to get recommendations.
Print the recommended skills to the user.

## Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for the project.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
re: Used for regular expressions to extract skills from resume text.
collections (Counter): Used for counting the frequency of skills.

## Algorithms
Skill Extraction: Regular expressions are used to identify and extract specific skills from resume text.
Skill Frequency Analysis: The Counter object is used to count the occurrences of skills and identify the most frequent ones.
Recommendation Generation: The recommendation logic is based on identifying the skills missing from the user's resume compared to the top skills for the target category.

## Usage
To use the Skills Recommendation System:
Replace the placeholder skill extraction logic in the extract_skills function with an appropriate method for your dataset.
Provide the user's resume text and target category as input.
Execute the skills_recommendation.py script.
The recommended skills will be printed to the console.

## Future Enhancements
Using more advanced techniques for skill extraction and analysis, like Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Incorporating factors like experience level and job requirements to refine recommendations.
Building a user interface for interacting with the system.
Expanding the dataset to cover more job categories and skills.
